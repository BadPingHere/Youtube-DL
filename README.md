# Youtube-DL

This is my take on a python youtube downloader, a project basically every python developer has made. 

# Features

### Folders

Organize your download's by video id by putting the output in a folder.

### Download a LOT

You can download the thumbnail, audio, and video in these options: Thumbnail, Video, Audio, Thumbnail and Video, Thumbnail and Audio.

# Instalation

1. Download and extract the code.
2. Download all the python packages. I would use ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```. If you wish to download 1080p+ videos, we require you to download [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
3. Run your python file, give it a url and parameters, and you are downloading!
